Guwahati:  The Congress is likely to be dethroned from power in Punjab with exit polls pointing to a landslide victory for the Aam Adami Party in the state. 
Poll of exit polls predicted that the Arvind Kejriwal-led party will win 41 per cent votes or 76-90 seats in the 117-member Assembly.
AAP leader Bhagwant Mann is the preferred candidate for Chief Minister in Punjab, people who were surveyed in the exit poll surveys said.  
If the exit poll matches the outcome on counting day, it would mean that AAP’s decision to declare comedian-turned-politician Bhagwant Mann as its chief ministerial candidate has paid off.
On the other hand, Congress will need to look at its decision to appoint Charanjit Singh Channi as Captain Amarinder Singh’s successor. The party is hoping that its choice of Channi as CM will ensure that Punjab’s Dalit voters will favour Congress.
