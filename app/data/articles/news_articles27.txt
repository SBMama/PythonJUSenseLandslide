SILCHAR: Heavy showers throughout the week had pushed Barak Valley virtually to a 'landlocked' region as both road and rail transport had been severed due to massive landslides.  
Meanwhile, NF railway had cancelled all the trains in the hill section on Saturday noon following landslides at least in 14 sites. The Bengaluru-bound Humsafar Express coming from Agartala was stranded at Badarpur. Silchar-Guwahati passenger train was stranded at Ditekcherra. A source in Badarpur railway station informed that a train had already moved towards the spot to clear the track. However, sources indicated that normal running of trains would take at least two more days.
