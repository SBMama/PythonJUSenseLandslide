Dima Hasao (Assam) [India], April 15 (ANI): Several vehicles got stuck on National Highway 54E near Kelolo village in Assam’s Dima Hasao district on Friday following a massive landslide in the area.
A heavy traffic jam was seen on the National Highway and several vehicles were stuck in the mud.

I ask NHAI and the company to keep men and machineries at vulnerable points. I will see the situation that things are going in right direction and we will not take it lightly,” DC of Dima Hasao district Nazreen Ahmed said.
