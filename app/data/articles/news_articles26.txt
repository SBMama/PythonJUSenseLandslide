Unnayan Shamannay, a non-governmental think-tank, today launched "Digital Budget Information Helpdesk" with an aim to enhance connectivity between the people and the budget-makers.
Through the helpdesk, stakeholders, including the parliamentarians, media professionals and researchers, will also get budget-related research and information support from the research team of Unnayan Shamannay.
Former information minister Hasanul Haq Inu, also chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on the information ministry inaugurated the helpdesk through a virtual programme.
Addressing the event, Prof Atiur Rahman, Unnayan Shamannay chairman and former Bangladesh Bank governor, said the budget for the next fiscal year is going to be proposed under special circumstances.
He said there are the demands for recovery following the pandemic and on the other hand, there is pressure to go for a somewhat contractionary fiscal policy in the context of the national macroeconomic situation caused by the geopolitical turmoil.
Stakeholders will be looking to this budget to direct towards a balanced approach. In this context, the services of the Digital Budget Information Helpdesk will be especially useful for the stakeholders, Atiur said.
